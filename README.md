## 📚 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to **machine learning systems that can generate content**, such as:
- 🖼️ Images
- 📝 Text
- 🎵 Music
- 🎙️ Audio
- 🎮 3D environments
- 🧬 DNA sequences
- 💻 Code

It’s **not just automation** — it’s **imagination at scale**, powered by data, math, and creativity.

## ⚙️ Historical Foundations

Generative AI isn’t brand new — it's rooted in ideas from the 1950s:

| Era | Milestone |
|-----|-----------|
| 1950s | Alan Turing’s ideas of machine intelligence |
| 1970s | Rule-based expert systems |
| 1980s | Symbolic AI, Markov Chains |
| 1990s | Probabilistic models, N-grams |
| 2000s | Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), HMMs |

The real boom started in the 2010s with **deep learning**.
