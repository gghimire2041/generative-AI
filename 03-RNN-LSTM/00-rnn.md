## Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to work with sequential data. Unlike feedforward networks that process fixed-size inputs, RNNs can handle variable-length sequences by maintaining internal memory through recurrent connections.

First introduced in the 1980s, RNNs have been fundamental in advancing natural language processing, time series analysis, and many other sequence modeling tasks. While transformer architectures have become dominant in many areas, RNNs remain important for understanding sequential modeling and are still used in many practical applications.

## What are RNNs?

### Definition
A Recurrent Neural Network is a type of neural network where connections between nodes form directed cycles, allowing information to persist and creating a form of memory.

### Key Characteristics
1. **Sequential Processing**: Process inputs one element at a time
2. **Memory**: Maintain hidden state that carries information across time steps
3. **Parameter Sharing**: Same weights used at each time step
4. **Variable Length**: Can handle sequences of different lengths

### The Memory Analogy
Think of RNNs like reading a book:
- You don't forget everything from previous pages when reading a new page
- Your understanding builds upon what you've read before
- Each new sentence is interpreted in the context of previous sentences
- The "memory" helps you understand references, themes, and narrative flow

## How RNNs Work

### The Unfolding Process

RNNs can be "unfolded" through time to visualize how they process sequences:

```
Input:  x₁  →  x₂  →  x₃  →  ...  →  xₜ
        ↓      ↓      ↓             ↓
State:  h₁  →  h₂  →  h₃  →  ...  →  hₜ
        ↓      ↓      ↓             ↓
Output: y₁     y₂     y₃            yₜ
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialize**: Start with initial hidden state h₀ (usually zeros)
2. **Process**: For each time step t:
   - Take input xₜ and previous hidden state hₜ₋₁
   - Compute new hidden state hₜ
   - Optionally compute output yₜ
3. **Repeat**: Continue until sequence ends
4. **Memory**: Hidden state hₜ carries information from all previous steps

### Information Flow
- **Forward**: Information flows from past to future through hidden states
- **Context**: Each prediction uses information from entire sequence history
- **Persistence**: Important information can be maintained across many time steps

---

## Mathematical Foundation

### Basic RNN Equations

#### Hidden State Update
```
hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ × hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ × xₜ + bₕ)
```

#### Output Computation
```
yₜ = Wₕᵧ × hₜ + bᵧ
```

Where:
- `hₜ` = hidden state at time t
- `xₜ` = input at time t
- `yₜ` = output at time t
- `Wₕₕ` = hidden-to-hidden weight matrix
- `Wₓₕ` = input-to-hidden weight matrix
- `Wₕᵧ` = hidden-to-output weight matrix
- `bₕ`, `bᵧ` = bias vectors

### Matrix Dimensions

For a sequence of length T with:
- Input dimension: d_in
- Hidden dimension: d_hidden
- Output dimension: d_out
- Batch size: N

**Weight Matrices:**
- Wₓₕ: (d_in, d_hidden)
- Wₕₕ: (d_hidden, d_hidden)
- Wₕᵧ: (d_hidden, d_out)

**Tensors:**
- Input X: (N, T, d_in)
- Hidden H: (N, T, d_hidden)
- Output Y: (N, T, d_out)

### Loss Function

For sequence prediction tasks:
```
L = (1/T) × Σₜ₌₁ᵀ loss(yₜ, y_true_t)
```

Common loss functions:
- **Classification**: Cross-entropy loss
- **Regression**: Mean squared error
- **Language Modeling**: Negative log-likelihood

## Types of RNNs

### 1. Vanilla RNN
**Structure**: Basic recurrent connection
**Equation**: hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕhₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕxₜ + bₕ)
**Pros**: Simple, fast
**Cons**: Vanishing gradient problem

### 2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
**Structure**: Gated architecture with cell state
**Components**: 
- Forget gate: Controls what to forget from cell state
- Input gate: Controls what new information to store
- Output gate: Controls what parts of cell state to output

**Key Innovation**: Separate cell state allows long-term memory

### 3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
**Structure**: Simplified version of LSTM
**Gates**: 
- Reset gate: Controls how much past information to forget
- Update gate: Controls how much to update hidden state

**Advantage**: Fewer parameters than LSTM, often similar performance

### 4. Bidirectional RNN
**Structure**: Two RNNs processing sequence in both directions
**Forward**: Processes sequence left-to-right
**Backward**: Processes sequence right-to-left
**Output**: Concatenation or combination of both directions

---

## Training RNNs

### Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

#### The Process
1. **Forward Pass**: Compute all hidden states and outputs
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compute loss at each time step
3. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients flowing backward through time
4. **Weight Update**: Update weights using computed gradients

#### Mathematical Derivation

**Output Gradient**:
```
∂L/∂yₜ = loss_gradient(yₜ, y_true_t)
```

**Hidden State Gradient**:
```
∂L/∂hₜ = ∂L/∂yₜ × ∂yₜ/∂hₜ + ∂L/∂hₜ₊₁ × ∂hₜ₊₁/∂hₜ
```

**Weight Gradients**:
```
∂L/∂Wₕₕ = Σₜ (∂L/∂hₜ × ∂hₜ/∂Wₕₕ)
∂L/∂Wₓₕ = Σₜ (∂L/∂hₜ × ∂hₜ/∂Wₓₕ)
```

#### Truncated BPTT
For very long sequences:
- Limit backpropagation to k time steps
- Trade-off between memory and gradient accuracy
- Helps with computational efficiency

### Training Algorithm

```python
def train_rnn(model, data, epochs):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch in data:
            # Forward pass
            hidden = initialize_hidden()
            loss = 0
            
            for t in range(sequence_length):
                output, hidden = model(input[t], hidden)
                loss += criterion(output, target[t])
            
            # Backward pass
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            
            # Gradient clipping (important for RNNs)
            torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
            
            optimizer.step()
```

        # Output layer
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)
    
    def forward(self, x, hidden=None):
        # Embed input
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        
        # RNN forward pass
        output, hidden = self.rnn(embedded, hidden)
        
        # Reshape for linear layer
        output = output.reshape(-1, self.hidden_size)
        output = self.fc(output)
        
        return output, hidden

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        out = self.fc(out)
        return out

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Remove special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]', '', text)
    
    # Tokenize
    tokens = text.split()
    
    return tokens

# Sequence preparation
def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    sequences = []
    targets = []
    
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        sequences.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
        targets.append(data[i+seq_length])
    
    return sequences, targets
```

#### Learning Rate Scheduling
```python
# Exponential decay
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ExponentialLR(optimizer, gamma=0.95)

# Reduce on plateau
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, patience=5)
```

#### Regularization Techniques
```python
# Dropout in RNN
self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, dropout=0.2)

# Weight decay
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-5)
```

### Evaluation and Monitoring

- **Regression**: MSE, MAE, correlation coefficient

#### Monitoring Training
```python
def evaluate_model(model, val_loader):
    model.eval()
    total_loss = 0
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data, targets in val_loader:
            output, _ = model(data)
            loss = criterion(output, targets)
            total_loss += loss.item()
    
    return total_loss / len(val_loader)

# Training loop with validation
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train_loss = train_epoch(model, train_loader)
    val_loss = evaluate_model(model, val_loader)
    
    print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Train Loss: {train_loss:.4f}, Val Loss: {val_loss:.4f}')
    
    # Early stopping
    if val_loss > best_val_loss:
        patience_counter += 1
    else:
        best_val_loss = val_loss
        patience_counter = 0
        save_model(model, 'best_model.pth')
    
    if patience_counter >= patience:
